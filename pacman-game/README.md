# PacMan Game
A simple Pac-Man game built in Java using the AWT and Swing libraries. Navigate Pac-Man through a maze, eat pellets to score points, and avoid four different ghosts. The game features collision detection with walls and ghosts, a scoring system, and a life count. The game ends when you lose all your lives.
